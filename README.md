# drum-kit-exercise

## About the exercise

- The **drum-kit-exercise** is a simple game built with **_VanillaJS_** only where you have a bunch of keys which have different sounds simulating a drum.

## The functionality

It's pretty simple to understand. 
This exercise has 3 files, the index.html, index.js and the styles.css.
- In the **index.html** I set all the basic informations and also the the JS in the <script> tag, over there you will see some function which controls when the sound will be played and when it will stop.
- In the **index.css** the only main important thing is the 'transition' in the 'key' class, which controls the transformation.
